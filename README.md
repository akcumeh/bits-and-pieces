## Overview

### About
Bits & Pieces will feature various parts of typical static websites - components like dropdowns, button / radio groups, navbars; site sections like landing pages, carousels, footers; and other little oddbits.

## My Process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Mobile-first workflow
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [jQuery](https://jquery.com)

### What I learned
### Useful resources

- This [FreeCodeCamp.org TailwindCSS course](https://youtu.be/ft30zcMlFao?si=hchw3KLEJxAoFnnX) - helped sort me out after I'd read the Tailwind docs but was still feeling lost.
- [blah](blah)

### Continued development

Bits & Pieces is like a granny square blanket (something I've been too busy to make for myself, unfortunately) - it will hopefully continue to have *bits and pieces* added to it as time goes on and before the year runs out. :D
